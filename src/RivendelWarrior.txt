Rivendel Warrior  v1  29 Aug 2006

This unit is for the Lord of the Rings Conflict of Arda mod by Red Warlord. It is in the Galadrim race and is built in the 
Rivendel Barracks. 

Its role is very simple: it fulfils Rivendel's lack of melee infantry. It looks similar to the Rivendel Archer, but with a 
curved Elven Blade instead of a Bow. He is a capable warrior, much like any Elf and can easily take on Orcs, Goblins 
and Men in a one-on-one situation. However, they are expensive and this can be exploited by swarming small groups 
of them, so he needs support from the Rivendel Archers to be used effectively. 

Installation:

If you have the TAK Switcher by Pocket_Geek (highly recommended), simply unzip RivendelWarrior.txt and 
RivendelWarrior.ufo into (C:\CAVEDOG\KINGDOMS\units). Launch the Switcher and select the unit from the units 
menu. Then launch Kingdoms and enjoy!

Alternatively, if you do not have the Switcher, or do not want to use it, follow these simple steps: 
1)Unzip the 'RivendelWarrior.ufo' to your TAK directory (C:\CAVEDOG\KINGDOMS) 
2)You will need a special shortcut to make this work. If you have 
  not already created one, follow these simple steps:
	1. Create a shortcut to Kingdoms.
   	2. Right-click on it and select 'Properties'.
   	3. append ' -disablecavedogverification' (without the quotes) to the 'Target' field.
   	4. Click 'OK'.
   	5. Rename your shortcut to "Kingdoms with mods" or anything similar.
3) Enter Kingdoms via your modified shortcut and enjoy!
